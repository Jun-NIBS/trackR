Blob detection is a crucial part of the tracking process. Finding good parameters 
for accurately separating the objects from each other will ensure better tracking 
results and reduce the amount of manual correction that may be required later. 

The `Blob detection` tab in `trackR` (see screenshot below) contains all the 
controls to parameterize the blob detection algorithm.

Three sliders control the parameters of the blob detection algorithm: 

+ `Smoothing factor` controls the amount of smoothing applied to the image before
  segmenting the blobs from the background. Larger amount of smoothing may help
  better detect objects with complex geometries and avoid breaking them up in 
  separate blobs. 
+ `Detection threshold` controls how much difference between pixels there should 
  be to classify them as belonging to the background or to objects. Larger values
  will reduce the number of object-classified pixels. Note: this option is not 
  available if you are using `trackR("quanta")` as it is not necessary in this 
  case. 
+ `Size range` controls the lower and upper bounds of the size range (in pixels)
  within which the objects are expected to sit. These values do not need to be 
  precise, they are mostly meant to filter out very small or very large false 
  positive objects. 
  
Every time you modify one of these three control parameters, the display window
will update itself to show the contours of the detected objects (see screenshot
below). We recommend that you parameterize the blob detection algorithm using a 
video frame in which the objects to track are clearly separated. You can navigate 
through the video to find such a frame using the `Frame` slider at the bottom of 
the control panel. 

Note: when using `trackR("tracktor")`, the display updating might take some time 
if too many blobs are detected and the results of the blob detection might not 
appear immediately. Wait a few seconds before making additional changes to the 
parameter values.

Once you have found a set of parameter values that works well for you, hit the 
`Record blobs` button. This will record the size distribution of the detected 
blobs. This is important for the tracking algorithm in case two objects are in 
close contact, and therefore merge into a single, larger blob. 

We recommend that you verify your blob detection parameters with multiple frames 
throughout the video. You can navigate through the video to find additional test 
frames using the `Frame` slider at the bottom of the control panel. As before,
try to find frames in which the objects to track are clearly separated. Adjust 
the blob detection parameters if necessary (but only the last set will be taken 
into account), and hit the `Record blobs` button each time you are satisfied with 
the blobs detected by `trackR`.
