`trackR` can use two different background subtraction methods in order to isolate 
objects from their surrounding background: 

1. **"Classic" background subtraction**: this method consists in subtracting an 
  image representing a fixed background from each frame of the video. Pixels with 
  high difference values in the resulting image will correspond to objects moving 
  in front of the background. 
2. **"Quantized" background subtraction**: this method consists in identifying 
  pixels that are significantly lighter or darker than the usual shade at their
  location in the image. This is accomplished by estimating for each pixel the 
  lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval of its distribution of shades.  
  If for a given image the pixel value falls outside of one of these bounds, then 
  the pixel is considered as belonging to an object and not to the background.
  
For instructions on "classic" background subtraction, go to ["Classic" background 
subtraction](#classic-background-subtraction).

For instructions on "quantized" background subtraction, go to ["Quantized" background 
subtraction](#quantized-background-subtraction)

### 1 - Using an existing background image {#classic1}

If you have recorded a background image of your experimental setup, or if you 
have created and saved one following the instructions in the 
[next section](#classic1), you can load it by clicking on the `Select background 
file or...` button in the `Background` tab (see screenshot above). This will 
bring up a file navigator. Use the file navigator to locate and select the 
background image that you would like to use. If the image is correctly loaded in 
`trackR`, it should appear in the display window. 

Note: the background image should have the same dimensions as the video. 

---

### 2 - Creating a background image from the video {#classic2}

If you do not have recorded a background image or want to create one from the 
video, you first need to select the number of video frames you would like to use
for estimating the background. You can do this using the `Number of frames` 
slider in the `Background` tab (see screenshot above). Selecting more images will 
usually lead to a more accurate result, but will take longer. 

Once you have selected a number of frames, you need to select the type of 
algorithms that you would like to use for estimating the background image. Two 
algorithms are available in `trackR`: 

1. `Mean`: this calculates an average image from the selected video frames. This 
  is a fast algorithm. However it does not always produce good results.
2. `Median`: this calculates a median image from the selected video frames. This 
  usually produces a better result than `Mean`, but will take a significantly
  longer amount of time. 
  
You can select the algorithm using the `Type` dropdown menu. You can then click 
on the `...Estimate background` button to start the computation of the background
image. 
  
Once the background image is estimated, it should appear in the display window. 
You can save this image for later use by clicking on the `Save background file`
button.

### 3 - Removing ghosts {#classic3}

In some instance (e.g. when an object does not move for a significant portion of 
the video), the background image may contain "ghosts". To remove a ghost, click 
on the `Select ghost for removal` button in the `Background` tab (see screenshot 
above). Then, use left-mouse clicks in the display window to draw a polygon around 
the ghost you want to remove (see image below for an example). Close the polygon 
using a right-mouse click. `trackR` will then use an inpainting algorithm to 
remove the ghost from the background image.

Repeat this operation as many times as necessary to remove all the unwanted 
ghosts. 

Note: inpainting is not an exact science and the result of removing ghosts may 
not be satisfying. In this case, use a more advanced image editing program such 
as Adobe Photoshop or Gimp to clean up your background image.

### 1 - Using an existing background image {#quanta1}

If you have created and saved a background image following the instructions in the 
[next section](#quanta2), you can load it by clicking on the `Select background 
file or...` button in the `Background` tab (see screenshot above). This will bring 
up a file navigator. Use the file navigator to locate and select the background 
image that you would like to use. If the image is correctly loaded in `trackR`, 
it should appear in the display window.

### 2 - Creating a background image from the video {#quanta2}

If you want to create a background image from the video, you first need to select 
the number of video frames you would like to use for estimating the background. 
You can do this using the `Number of frames` slider in the `Background` tab (see 
screenshot above). Selecting more images will usually lead to a more accurate 
result, but will take longer. 

Once you have selected a number of frames, you need to select the type of 
object that you would like to track. If the objects are generally darker than 
the background, select `Objects darker than the background` in the `type` dropdown 
menu. Otherwise, select `Objects lighter than the background`. 

You can then click on the `...Estimate background` button to start the computation 
of the background image. 
  
Once the background image is estimated, it should appear in the display window. 
You can save this image for later use by clicking on the `Save background file`
button.
