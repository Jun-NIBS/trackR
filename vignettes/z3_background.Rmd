`trackR` uses two different algorithms in order to isolate objects from their 
surrounding background: 

1. **Background subtraction**: this method consists in subtracting an image 
  representing a fixed background from each frame of the video. Pixels with high
  values in the resulting image will correspond to objects moving in front of 
  the background. 
2. **Adaptive thresholding**: this method consists in setting all pixels whose 
  intensities are above a threshold to white and all the remaining pixels to 
  black. In conventional thresholding, the threshold value is the same for all 
  pixels. In adaptive thresholding however, the threshold changes dynamically 
  over the image and is based on the local contrast between each pixel and its 
  immediate surrounding. This allows for the easy detection of dark objects on a 
  light background, and vice versa. 
  
The first method is usually more precise for object detection, but it requires 
that the background remains fixed for the entire duration of the experiment. The 
second method does not require that the background remains fixed, as long as the 
objects to track are always darker (resp. lighter) than their lighter (resp. 
darker) background. Which method you should choose will depend on the recording 
conditions of your experiment.

If you choose to use adaptive thresholding, you can skip this section and move 
directly to the next step. If you choose background subtraction, please follow 
the instructions below to load a background image (if you have recorded one) or 
create one from the video.

## 1 - Using an existing background image 

If you have recorded a background image of your experimental setup, or if you 
have created and saved one following the instructions in the 
[next section](#creating-a-background-image-from-the-video), you can load it 
by clicking on the `Select background file or...` button in the `Background` tab 
(see screenshot above). This will bring up a file navigator. Use the file navigator 
to locate and select the background image that you would like to use. If the image 
is correctly loaded in `trackR`, it should appear in the display window. 

Note: the background image should have the same dimensions as the video.

## 2 - Creating a background image from the video

If you do not have recorded a background image or want to create one from the 
video, you first need to select the number of video frames you would like to use
for estimating the background. You can do this using the `Number of frames` 
slider in the `Background` tab (see screenshot above). Selecting more images will 
usually lead to a more accurate result, but will take longer. 

Once you have selected a number of frames, you need to select the type of 
algorithms that you would like to use for estimating the background image. Two 
algorithms are available in `trackR`: 

1. `Mean`: this calculates an average image from the selected video frames. This 
  is a fast algorithm. However it does not always produce good results.
2. `Median`: this calculates a median image from the selected video frames. This 
  usually produces a better result than `Mean`, but will take a significantly
  longer amount of time. 
  
You can select the algorithm using the `Type` dropdown menu. You can then click 
on the `...Estimate background` button to start the computation of the background
image. 
  
Once the background image is estimated, it should appear in the display window. 
You can save this image for later use by clicking on the `Save background file`
button.

## 3 - Removing ghosts

In some instance (e.g. when an object does not move for a significant portion of 
the video), the background image may contain "ghosts". To remove a ghost, click 
on the `Select ghost for removal` button in the `Background` tab (see screenshot 
above). Then, use left-mouse clicks in the display window to draw a polygon around 
the ghost you want to remove (see image below for an example). Close the polygon 
using a right-mouse click. `trackR` will then use an inpainting algorithm to 
remove the ghost from the background image.

Repeat this operation as many times as necessary to remove all the unwanted 
ghosts. 

Note: inpainting is not an exact science and the result of removing ghosts may 
not be satisfying. In this case, use a more advanced image editing program such 
as Adobe Photoshop or Gimp to clean up your background image.
