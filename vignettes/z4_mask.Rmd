In order to improve the tracking performance of `trackR`, it can be useful to 
exclude some parts of the video (e.g. everything outside the experimental tank 
or arena). `trackR` uses mask images in order to achieve this. Mask images are 
black and white images (see example below) in which the black pixels correspond
to pixels that should be excluded from the analysis.

`trackR` does not (yet) offer the possibility to create mask images. However 
mask images are easy to create with any image editing program such as Adobe 
Photoshop or Gimp. Simply import a frame of the video into your image editing 
software and replace all the parts of the image you would like to exclude with 
pure black pixels, and all the parts of the image you would like to keep with 
pure white pixels. 

Note: the mask image should have the same dimensions as the video. 

Once you have created your mask image, you can load it in `trackR` by clicking 
on the `Select mask file` button in the `Background` tab (see screenshot below).
This will bring up a file navigator. Use the file navigator to locate and select 
the mask image that you would like to use.

If the image is correctly loaded in `trackR`, the display window should show all 
the excluded parts as pure black, as shown in the example below on the right 
side.
