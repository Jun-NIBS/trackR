At any time during the parameterization of `trackR`, you can save your tracking
parameters for later use.

In order to do this, simply click on the `Save settings` button at the bottom of 
the control panel. The settings will be saved at a location of your choice in the
form of a `.Rds` file. 

To restore saved settings, click on the `Load settings` button, navigate to the 
location of a previously saved `.Rds` setting file and select it. This should 
restore `trackR` to the state it was in when you first saved these settings.
